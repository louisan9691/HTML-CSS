    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <p>A <i>potager</i> is a French term for an ornamental vegetable or kitchen garden.
    Often flowers (edible and non-edible) and herbs are planted with the vegetable
    to enhance the garden's beauty/ The goal is to make the function of providing food
    aesthetically pleasing.</p>

    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <p>Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for their color and form.
    Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potoger can provide food, cut flowers
    and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers can disguise their function
    of providing for a home in a wide array of forms - form the carefree style of the cottage
    garden to the formality of a knot garden.</p>
