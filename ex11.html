    <h2>A heat wrapped in fur</h2>
    <p id="description"> The <span id="briad">briad</span>, or berger de brie,
    is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>

    <h3>Breed History</h3>
    <p id="content">The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd
      and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search
      for wounded soldiers because of tis fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War
      almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering.
      Charlemangne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.
