  <h1>The Story in the Book </h1>
  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
  <br />
  <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.
  On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientest</em>,
  and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
  thumbned copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since
  college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    She had spent the last ten years un this room, sitting under a poster
    with an Oscar Widle quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who
    have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
    the secrets of the Ilama <abbr title="Deoxyrucbonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be outstanding achievement,
     Moly <em>did</em> think she had something better
    to do.
